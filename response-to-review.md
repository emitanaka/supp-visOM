# Response to review

1. Change the title from "Uprooting sub-standard visualization practices..." to "Incorporating statistical thinking into visualization practices..."

DONE

2. Page 2, before the middle paragraph that criticizes Fig 3, please add a paragraph on what *is* useful in the Basole et al. paper.

ADDITIONAL POSITIVE SENTENCES IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF PAPER

3. Page 2, middle paragraph, please avoid using capitalized words: "there is NO strong association" --> "there is no strong association"

DONE

4. Final para before Section 3: move to the beginning of Section 3 which talks about single plots. But drop the opening sentence "Making assertions from a single plot is flawed", since Sec 3 title already says that.

DONE

5. Section 4, end of first para: modify language of sentence "The ease of graph production however does not prevent sub-standard visualisation practices." --> "The ease of graph production however does not assure the quality of visualisation practices."

DONE

Those are all minor and I hope you'll agree to make those changes.

Two final things:
1. We loved the code and examples on Emi's website (https://emitanaka.org/supp-visOM/). Thanks for urging me to get the data from the authors. As with all IJDS submissions, we'd like to have this as part of the IJDS assets linked to your paper: Can Emi please create a Code Ocean capsule and "submit to IJDS" (see instructions here: https://pubsonline.informs.org/pb-assets/Files%20IJDS/Instructions%20for%20authors-IJDS-1611325887.pdf). You can mention both the Code Ocean capsule and Emi's webpage URL in the Supplementary Materials.

**This has been done and we have been provided with a provisional DOI: http://doi.org/10.24433/CO.2743770.v1 so should only be made public when the article is finall accepted.**
 
2. Fig 1 in your commentary displays negative R-squared values -- best to remove them.

DONE
