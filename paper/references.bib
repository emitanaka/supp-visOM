abstract = {Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a novel representation-transparent approach to visualization
for the web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific
abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation:
the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input
data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate
and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness
and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable
notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation
of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally,
we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic
performance improvements over intermediate representations.},
